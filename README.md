## How It Works

- The recent changes are fetched from the Wikipedia API using a simple query that retrieves a list of recent changes, including the title, user, timestamp, and comments.
- The data is refreshed every 20 seconds to ensure the page shows the most recent changes.
- The date and time of the changes are displayed in both UTC and IST.
- Language-specific audio files are used to play a sound notification when new changes are detected. This helps **visually impaired users** by alerting them to updates, so they can focus on other tasks or tabs without missing important changes.

## Date and Time of Update

The recent changes data is refreshed every 20 seconds. The **Date and Time** of the most recent update will be displayed in both **UTC** and **Indian Standard Time (IST)**. The page will show the **exact timestamp** when the data was last fetched, ensuring users are aware of the recency of the changes.
